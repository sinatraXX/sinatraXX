# Hello, World!👋
Hereby I welcome you to the lair of my selected projects that I've made

## ♠️ Behind the Screen ♠️
- During my free time, I love to explore game playtesting. I've engaged myself in several private betas and technical tests for a mouthful of PC games.
- I also used to sign up as Windows Insider specifically for Windows Phone (around 2014-2015). I managed to alpha/beta test Windows 10 Mobile before it got released to public. I also gave feedbacks on any changes made by the developers and report if there's any bug that I've encountered.
- This might come off as surprising, but Tetris is my all time favorite game!

## 🙇‍♀️ Well...
Thank you so much for coming here! Hope you enjoy your stay and if you're willing to, I can't wait to work together!


xoxo,
