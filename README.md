# Hello, World!👋
Hereby I welcome you to the lair of my selected projects that I've made

## ♦️ A little bit about me ♦️
- 👋 Hi, I’m Aisyah Ramadhania (or some people prefer to call me Aisy or Aicha)
- 👀 I have huge interests in Information Security, UI Designs, and also Internet Governance
- 🌱 I’m currently a 5th semester student majoring in Cyber Security
- 🏆 I'm also CEH v11 certified

### ♠️ Behind the Screen ♠️
- During my free time, I love to explore game playtesting. I've engaged myself in several private betas and technical tests for a mouthful of PC games.
- I also used to sign up as Windows Insider specifically for Windows Phone (around 2014-2015). I managed to alpha/beta test Windows 10 Mobile before it got released to public. I also gave feedbacks on any changes made by the developers and report if there's any bug that I've encountered.
- This might come off as surprising, but Tetris is my all time favorite game!
